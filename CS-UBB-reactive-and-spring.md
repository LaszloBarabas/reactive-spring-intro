# Reactive programming with Spring 

## Reactive system 

Any  application should react to changes:

- any changes in demand (load) 
- any changes in the availability of services 

these kinf of  app should be **reactive** to any changes that affects the system ability to response to user request 

Main features of the **reactive**  app : 
- ability to stay responsive under a varying workload
- throughput of the system should increase automatically when more users start using it
- should decrease automatically when the demand goes down.

In the interconnected world of microservices one possible botleneck could be the blocking communication among microservices with ex Spring Boot + http based communication.

## Reactive Programming 

### Observer real life situation 

![Observer  real life situation ](C://Users//barabas.laszlo//Repo-2//training-assets//spring-reactive//img//observer-patter-real-life-small.png) 

### Observer design pattern as a solution

### Reactive solution with java libraries 

Reactive solution main building blocks: Observer + Iterator design pattern implemented in
- RxJava 1.X
- RxJava 2.x 

However not fully succesfull. 

### Reactive Stream spec 

The Reactive Streams **specification** defines the following  interfaces: 

- `Publisher<T>` ( start point of the communication)
- `Subscriber<T>` (end point of the communication), 
- `Subscription` (handle the  start - end points relation), 
- and `Processor <T, R>`  (some transformation logic).

by introducing the  *pull-push*  data exchange model resolves  the *backpressure* issue.

## Projector Reactor as implementation of the Reactive Stream Spec

- Project Reactor 1.x 
- Project Reactor 2.x   

Adding Reactor to the Spring (5.x) project

```Groovy 
compile("io.projectreactor:reactor-core:3.2.0.RELEASE")
//...
testCompile("io.projectreactor:reactor-test:3.2.0.RELEASE")  
```
Reactive types â€“ Flux and Mono as `Publisher<T>` implementation 

- `Flux`  defines a reactive stream that can produce zero, one, or many elements


![Reactive stream  as Flux  ](C://Users//barabas.laszlo//Repo-2//training-assets//spring-reactive//img//flux-react-stream-small.png)

Flux stream transformed into another Flux stream


 `Mono`  defines a reactive stream that can produce zero, or one element
![Reactive stream  as Mono  ](C://Users//barabas.laszlo//Repo-2//training-assets//spring-reactive//img//mono-react-stream-small.png)

Example of Reactive Flux streams 
```Java
Flux<String>  stream1 = Flux.just("Hello","world");
Flux<Integer> stream2 = Flux.fromArray(newInteger[]{1,2,3});
Flux<Integer> stream3 = Flux.fromIterable(Arrays.asList(9, 8, 7));
//....
Flux<Integer> stream4 = Flux.range(2019, 9); // starting with 2019 generate 9 elements 
```

Example of Reactive Mono streams 
```Java
Mono<String> stream5 = Mono.just("One");
Mono<String> stream6 = Mono.justOrEmpty(null);
Mono<String> stream7 = Mono.justOrEmpty(Optional.empty());
//...
Mono<String> stream8 = Mono.fromCallable(()->httpRequest()); // handling a asynchronous requests http|db  
// shorthener way 
Mono<String> stream8 = Mono.fromCallable(this::httpRequest);
```

Use cases with different `subscribe` functions.   

```Java
Flux.just("A","B","C")
  .subscribe(
        data -> log.info("onNext: {}", data),
        err ->{ /* ignored  */ },
        ()-> log.info("onComplete")
      );
```
```Java
   Flux.just("A","B","C")
                .subscribe(
                        data -> log.info("onNext: {}", data),
                        err ->{ /* ignored  */ },
                        () -> log.info("onComplete")
                );

```


```Java
  Flux.range(1, 100)
                .subscribe(
                        data -> log.info("onNext: {}", data),
                        err -> { /* ignore */ },
                        () -> log.info("onComplete"),
                        subscription -> {
                            subscription.request(4);
                            //subscription.cancel();
                            log.info("Request end for 4 ");
                            subscription.request(4);
                        }
                );
```
